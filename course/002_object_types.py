# OBJECTS

'''
In Python, an object is any "thing" in Python that can be named.
Objects are named so you don't have to refer to them by their description.

Like how you may refer to your pet dog by saying "Alfred", as opposed to saying "you quadrupedal with an acute sense of smell".
'''

'''
Objects have a type and properties.
For example, Alfred is a type of Dog.
Some of Alfred's properties may include it's behavior such as barking or his brown hair color.
