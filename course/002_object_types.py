# OBJECTS

'''
In Python, an object is any "thing" in Python that can be named.
Objects are named so you don't have to refer to them by their description.

Like how you may refer to your pet dog by saying "Alfred", as opposed to saying "you quadrupedal with an acute sense of smell".
'''

'''
Objects have a type and properties.
For example, Alfred is a type of Dog.
Some of Alfred's properties may include it's behavior such as barking or his brown hair color.

# VARIABLE = object given a name
# A variable has a name and a value (an object)
# The name must start with a letter or underscore, and can contain numbers, letters, or underscore
# How do we assign a variable? Using the '=' sign
x = 1
# In math, the equal sign indicates an equality. In programming, it indicates that we are setting something equal to another.

# Some types of objects that be assigned a variables:

# INTEGERS (int type)
# Whole numbers.
a = 3
b = -4
age = 72

# FLOATS (float type)
# Decimal numbers
x = 0.2
y = 3.0
weight = 132.3

# BOOLEANS (bool type)
# True or False
summer = True
winter = False

# STRINGS (str type)
# Series of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, etc.)
greeting = "Hey Bob! How's it going?"
car = "2017 Porsche 911 Carrera"
pet = "Alfred the Dog"

# NO VALUE (NoneType type)
# "None" is the "null" in Python
nothing = None
tokens = None


# You can check the type of a variable w/ type()

# You can change certain types of variables to other types (i.e. "casting")
# int(), float(), bool(), str()
