# PRINT to console

# Using print() you can print any type of object(s)

print("Hello World")

a=3
b=2
print(a+b)

# You can also mix and match types of objects with the use of commas
greeting="Hi, I'm" #string
age=19 #integer
end_greeting="years old." #string
print(greeting, age, end_greeting)
# Note that this automatically inserts spaces in between the objects
# You could also make the objects a string using str()
print("Hi, I'm " + str(age) + " years old.")
# Note that in the above, we needed to add spaces in our strings
