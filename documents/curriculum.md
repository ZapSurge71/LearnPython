### Common Errors and How to debug them

Stuff in Day_1/basics/

### Dividing up Tasks

Provide example of complicated program ppl use everyday.
Explain that it's made up of multiple modules of code, breaking a big problem into smaller problems,
each with its own purpose to fulfill a certain task. And once you've made a module for a specific task,
it's easy to use it again and again in different places.

In Python, these modules that complete subtasks are called functions.
Functions can have input or none at all.
*Parameters vs Arguments*

`functions.py`

Functions need to be called
Explain what happens when a function is called

### Misc

Perhaps show students something, then do something together with them, and then give them a practice exercise or two.
